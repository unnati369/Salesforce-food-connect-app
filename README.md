# Salesforce-food-connect-app

This project seeks to address the dual challenges of food waste and food insecurity, which frequently coexist within the same communities, by offering a comprehensive solution to tackle both simultaneously. Our approach involves connecting surplus food suppliers—such as local restaurants, grocery stores, and food producers—with individuals and families in need. Through strategic partnerships, we will recover food that remains safe and nutritious but is at risk of being wasted, and redistribute it to those facing limited access to healthy meals.
